        <h2>Machine Learning Autonomous Robot Competition</h2>
        <p>UBC, Vancouver | January 2023 â€“ April 2023</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Engineered control software for an autonomous simulated robot in a student competition</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented a driving algorithm leveraging OpenCV and imitation learning for efficient navigation, ensuring collision avoidance with other vehicles and pedestrians</li>
            <li>Applied OpenCV techniques for precise license plate isolation and successfully trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately recognize license plate characters</li>
            <li>Secured the 2nd place position among 32 teams, underscoring the effectiveness of the developed algorithms and strategies</li>
        </ul>
