        <h2>Hand Motion Controlled Mini-Mech</h2>
        <p>UBC, Vancouver | January 2024 â€“ April 2024</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            This project aims to create a tabletop-scaled version of the Prosthesis mech suit, enabling intuitive control via a glove-based system that maps finger movements to the mech's legs. Sponsored by Exosapien Technologies, this 1:20 scale prototype uses servo motors for actuation and flex sensors for control.
        </p>

        <h3>Design and Approach</h3>
        <h4>Mechanical Design</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Selected micro MG90 servo motors for their torque and cost-effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Used a geared joint mechanism for compact, aesthetic leg movement.</li>
            <li>Designed a simplified chassis for easier 3D printing and assembly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Glove Design</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Flex sensors mounted on gloves track finger motion.</li>
            <li>Sensors are connected to ESP32 microcontrollers for wireless control.</li>
            <li>Implemented a sliding sheath design to prevent sensor distortion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Integration and Controls</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Used the ESP32 microcontroller to map flex sensor data to servo positions.</li>
            <li>Added noise reduction through averaging and calibration routines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Testing and Results</h3>
        <p>
            The prototype was tested for servo torque, noise levels, and user intuitiveness. The mech demonstrated smooth movements and reliable communication, though stability during walking remains a challenge.
        </p>

        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Adjust chassis design to lower the center of mass for improved stability.</li>
            <li>Refine the mapping between finger motion and mech leg movement.</li>
            <li>Use screws instead of glue for securing servo gears in future iterations.</li>
        </ul>
